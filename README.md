WPF3DGrid
=========
A WPF 3D demo I made to try out ray tracing to a background element. When you click the tile will change to an inverse color scheme. The tiles are hexes and require that they be laid in an offset pattern.

Another objective of the project was to populate the scene programmatically. Most WPF / Silverlight examples the view is almost entirely done in markup and the content of the panels, or colors of the polygons are applied later. The view starts off bare and the rest of the elements and viewport are all configured at run time.

Lastly I was really excited about property assignment at contsruction and lambdas at the time so I attempted to make the code look as if C# was a functional language.
